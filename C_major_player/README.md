## 💡Concepts Used in This Project

* 8051 microcontroller assembly language
* MCU 8051 IDE
* I/O ports
* Timer
* Interrupts

## 🎯 Purpose

The aim of this project is to play C major scale on 8051 microcontroller using external speaker. Each note is played for 0.5 seconds. After all 8 notes in the scale is played, loop starts again. 



## 🔓 Algorithm & Methodology

For C major scale, A440 pitch standard is used in this project. You may reach necessary frequencies for each note from this [link](https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html).  
There are 2 different timers in 8051. Timer0 is used to watch the frequency of a note. Timer1 is used to watch 0.5s period for each note.
